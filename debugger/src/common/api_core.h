/**
 * @page dbg_overview Overview
 * 
 * @par Overview
 *      This debugger was specially developed as a software utility to interact
 *      with our SOC implementation in \c riscv_soc repository. The main
 *      purpose was to provide convinient way to develop and debug our 
 *      Satellite Navigation firmware that can not be debugged by any other 
 *      tool provided RISC-V community. Additionally, we would like to use
 *      the single unified application capable to work with Real and Simulated
 *      platforms without any modification of source code.
 *      Debugger provides base functionality such as: run control,
 *      read/write memory, registers and CSRs, breakpoints. It allows to
 *      reload FW image and reset target.
 *      Also we are developing own version of the CPU simulator
 *      (analog of \c spike) that can be extended with peripheries models to
 *      Full SOC simulator. These extensions for the debugger simplify
 *      porting procedure (Zephyr OS for an example) so that 
 *      simulation doesn't require any hardware and allows to develop SW and HW
 *      simultaneously.

/**
 * @defgroup dbg_prj_structure_g Project structure
 * @ingroup debugger_group
 * @page dbg_prj_structure Project structure
 *
 * General idea of the project is to develop one \c Core library 
 * providing API methods for registering \c classes, \c services, \c attributes
 * and methods to interact with them. Each extension plugin registers one or 
 * several class services performing some usefull work. All plugins are 
 * built as an independent libraries that are opening by \c Core library
 * at initialization stage with the call of method <b>plugin_init()</b>.
 * All Core API methods start with \c RISCV_... prefix:
 * @code
 *   void RISCV_register_class(IFace *icls);
 *
 *   IFace *RISCV_create_service(IFace *iclass, const char *name, 
 *                               AttributeType *args);
 *
 *   IFace *RISCV_get_service(const char *name);
 *   ...
 * @endcode
 *
 * Configuration of the debugger and plugins is fully described in JSON
 * formatted configuration files <b>targets/target_name.json</b>.
 * These files store all instantiated services names, attributes values
 * and interconnect among plugins.
 * This configuration can be saved to/load from file at any
 * time. By default command \c exit will save current debugger state into
 * file (including full command history). 
 *
 * @note You can manually add/change new Registers/CSRs names and indexes
 *       by modifying this config file without changing source code.
 * 
 * @par Folders description
 *    -# \b libdgb64g - Core library (so/dll) that provides standard API 
 * methods defined in file \c api_core.h.
 *    -# \b appdbg64g - Executable (exe) file implements functionality of

 *                     \c ROMs and etc.

 /**

 * @ingroup debugger_group
 * @page dbg_connect Debug session
 *
 * @section dbg_connect_1 Plugins interaction
 *
 * Core library uses UDP protocol to communicate with all targets: FPGA or
 * simulators. The general structure is looking like on the following figure:
 *
 * <img src="pics/dbg_sim.png" alt="sim debug"> 
 * @latexonly {\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{pics/dbg_sim.png}} @endlatexonly
 *
 * or with real Hardware
 *
 * <img src="pics/dbg_fpga.png" alt="fpga debug"> 
 * @latexonly {\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{pics/dbg_fpga.png}} @endlatexonly
 *
 * GUI plugin uses QT-libraries and interacts with the core library using the
 * text console input interface. GUI generates the same text commands 
 * that are available in debugger console for any who's using this debugger.
 * That's why any presented in GUI widgets information can be achieved
 * in console mode.
 *
 * @section dbg_connect_2 Start Debugger
 *
 * We provide several targets that can run software (bootloader, firmware
 * or user specific application) without any source code modifications:
 * 
 * Start Configuration            | Description
 * -------------------------------|-----------------
 * $ ./_run_functional_sim.sh[bat]| Functional RISC-V Full System Model
 * $ ./_run_systemc_sim.sh[bat]   | Use SystemC Precise Model of RIVER CPU
 * $ ./_run_fpga_gui.sh[bat]      | FPGA board. Default port 'COM3', TAP IP = 192.168.0.51
 *
 * To run debugger with the real FPGA target connected via Ethernet do:
 * @code
 *     # cd rocket_soc/debugger/win32build/debug
 *     # _run_functional_sim.bat
 * @endcode
 *
 * The result should look like on the picture below:
 * 
 * <img src="pics/dbg_gui_start.png" alt="debugger 1-st look"> 
 * @latexonly {\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{pics/dbg_gui_start.png}} @endlatexonly
 *
 * @par Example of the debug session
 * Switch ON all User LEDs on board:
 * @code
 *      riscv# help                     -- Print full list of commands
 *      riscv# csr MCPUID               -- Read supported ISA extensions
 *      riscv# read 0xfffff000 20       -- Read 20 bytes from PNP module
 *      riscv# write 0x80000000 4 0xff  -- Write into GPIO new LED value
 *      riscv# loadelf helloworld       -- Load elf-file to board RAM and run
 * @endcode
 *          
 * Console mode view

 *
 * @section dbg_connect_3 Debug Zephyr OS kernel with symbols
 *
 * Build Zephyr kernel from scratch using our patches enabling 64-bits RISC-V
 * architecture support:
 * @code
 *     $ mkdir zephyr_160
 *     $ cd zephyr_160
 *     $ git clone https://gerrit.zephyrproject.org/r/zephyr
 *     $ cd zephyr
 *     $ git checkout tags/v1.6.0
 *     $ cp ../../riscv_vhdl/zephyr/v1.6.0-riscv64-base.diff .
 *     $ cp ../../riscv_vhdl/zephyr/v1.6.0-riscv64-exten.diff .
 *     $ git apply v1.6.0-riscv64-base.diff
 *     $ git apply v1.6.0-riscv64-exten.diff
 * @endcode
 *
 * Then build elf-file:
 * @code
 *    $ export ZEPHYR_BASE=/home/zephyr_160/zephyr
 *    $ cd zephyr/samples/shell
 *    $ make ARCH=riscv64 CROSS_COMPILE=/home/your_path/gnu-toolchain-rv64ima/bin/riscv64-unknown-elf- BOARD=riscv_gnss 2>&1
 * @endcode
 *
 * Load debug symbols from elf-file without target reprogramming (or with):
 * @code
 *    riscv# loadelf zephyr.elf
 *    riscv# loadelf zephyr.elf nocode
 * @endcode
 *
 * <img src="pics/dbg_gui_symb.png" alt="debugger symbols"> 
 * @latexonly {\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{pics/dbg_gui_symb.png}} @endlatexonly
 * 
 * Now becomes available the following features:
 * - Stack trace with function names
 * - Function names in Disassembler including additional information for
 *   branch and jump instructions in column \c 'comment'.
 * - Symbol Browser with filter.
 * - Opening Disassembler and Memory Viewer widgets in a new window by name.
 *
 * Debugger provides additional features that could simplify software
 * development: 
 * - Clock Per Instruction (CPI) hardware measure
 * - Bus utilization information 
 * - Others. List of a new features is constantly increasing.
